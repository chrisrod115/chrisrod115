## üöÄ About Me

I'm a versatile Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Embedded Systems and a growing passion for Full Stack Development. Currently at Northrop Grumman, I specialize in developing and testing safety-critical software for aerospace applications (like the UH-60V Black Hawk) following rigorous standards like DO-178C. I thrive on bridging the hardware-software gap and building robust, efficient solutions.

My experience includes enhancing system reliability through meticulous software implementation, achieving 100% code coverage with automated Python test scripts, and significantly boosting team productivity (by 30%) through automation tool development. I'm also adept at working with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins) and utilizing comprehensive testing tools like LDRA Testbed.

Previously at Southern California Edison, I gained valuable experience in electrical engineering, designing relay protection tests, developing PLC logic control systems, and integrating complex control networks using SCADA, PLC, HMI, and C++.

I'm excited by the challenge of building complete systems, from low-level hardware interaction and firmware development to creating responsive and interactive user interfaces. I'm actively expanding my skillset in web technologies and looking for opportunities where I can leverage my diverse background to contribute to innovative projects in either embedded systems or full-stack roles.
